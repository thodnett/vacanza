Travel-Vacanza
================

A single page travel website, with a map that relies on the google places api to
search for hotels in different countries. It also contains a restaurant search
engine.

UX
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I created the website for use as a travel aid to people looking for inspiration 
on where to stay or eat. 

Features
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Fixed navbar for easy navigation of the site.
* Google map for searching for hotels and attractions in a city.
* Restaurant search engine for finding a place to eat in chosen city.
* Social links to share your search results

Technologies used
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
* jQuery - used to power elements on the site.
* Bootstrap - to add style and elements to the page.
* Google Maps Api - used to create the hotel search engine.
* Zomato Api - used to create the restaurant search engine.
* Fontawesome - for the icons used.

Testing
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Navbar - Tested to ensure it was responsive on different size devices and 
   to check that it directs to the correct anchor tags.
2. Google Map - Tested to ensure it works by selcting a country then entering 
   a city, it brings up the hotels as expected. It also shows nearby attractions.
3. Zomato restaurant search - Tested by entering a city or cuisine into the search
   bar and it returns the correct information.
4. Tested the deployed project on various screen sizes and it responds well.
